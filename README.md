# HMM_TGB
MATLAB scripts for analysing the FTLD Tiagabine data using OSL Hidden Markov Modelling toolbox

These are the scripts I have used to analyse the Tiagabine dataset using the OSL toolbox to do HMM analysis

There are also scripts for the preprocessing steps necessary for AEC analysis but I did not have time to do this in the end

Addtionally, there are scripts for rending results onto 3D brain surfaces. These make use of Darren Price's toolboxes available: https://github.com/dprice80/mni2fs
